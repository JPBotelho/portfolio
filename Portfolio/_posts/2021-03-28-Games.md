This was a rhythm game made in 48h for GamesForGood 2019 with me, [Kagamihara](https://kagamihara.itch.io/), [Lipera](https://itch.io/profile/lipera) on code, [Kamaraum](https://itch.io/profile/kamaraum) on sound and [Mateus Boga](https://www.instagram.com/mateusboga/) on art in the Unity Engine.


### **The Challenge**

We were building a rhythm game and needed a way to generate the spawn in the note feed for the player to hit in time with the music. Turns out, that's kinda hard. We didn't have enough time for procedural pitch detection or any generic solution, we needed a dirty hack.

The solution? I wrote a script in Unity that took your keypresses and stored them as notes. Then, when the game started, it played back the keypresses as notes in realtime. Basically, we had our composer listen to the song and play it on the arrow keys in a single take and that would serve as the "note map".

This worked susprisingly well; granted there was some delay due to human error but it was good enough to pass as working.

In retrospect, this probably would have worked better if I had taken the song's bpm into account, "rounding" the timing of the generated notes to 16th notes.

But regardless, it felt like an ingenious hack for a problem that would be impossible to tackle in 2 days.

The notes were coming in from the right side of the screen.

This game was made for GamesForGood 2018 in 48h with an artist and 2 other programmers. It was my first presential Game Jam and it was a great experience.


### My Contribution 
I did some general programming here and there, but the most notable one is the health bar. I wrote about it [here]({% post_url 2021-03-27-VisualEffects %}#health-bar).

## Gravity
I made this game in 48h for Ludum Dare 36 in Aug. 2016 in the Unity engine. The theme was "Ancient Technology" and I found a way to bend it to the idea that I had brewing in the back of my mind to control the orientation of gravity by saying it was made by aliens or something.

It was one of my first projects, so it is rather simple. I made some more levels and features after the Game Jam for an android "release". There were no notable challenges for this one, but it is a neat little game.
