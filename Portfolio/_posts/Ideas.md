## [Music Video Generator](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Music-Video-Generator)
Generates cover video given folder with tracks and album art, using FFMPEG.

## [Discord Bot](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Music-Hoarders-Bot)
Discord bot with search capabilities in Youtube, Discogs and Musicbrainz.

# Graphical Engines

## [C# OpenGL Engine](https://github.com/JPBotelho/OpenGL-Sandbox)
Barebones engine that implements model loading, skyboxes and simple shadowmapping.

## [Peanut Shader Engine](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Peanut-Shader-Engine)
An attempt to build a sandbox to build pixel shaders, facilitating input of textures and external variables. Ideally an offline Shatertoy, in practice an incomplete, simple quad renderer.

# Visual Effects
## [Camouflage Shader](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Camouflage-Shader)
Applies a camouflage texture based on a pre-defined map. 

## [Dissolve Effect](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Dissolve-Shader)
Makes an object progressively transparent based on a noise map.

## [Triplanar Mapping](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Triplanar-Mapping)
Allows for axis-based coloring and texturing, allowing for example, to fake snow on top of an object.

## [Procedural Toon Shader](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Procedural-Toon-Shader)
Makes the lighting calculation not linear, instead it samples from a curve with predefined steps and giving a stylized look.

# Mathematical Visualization

## [2D Fractals](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Fractal-Megacollection)
Implementation of fractal formulas, such as Mandelbrot, Julia and Newton. Includes 9 coloring techniques applies to the Mandelbrot set.

## [Raymarched Fractals](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Raymarched-Fractals)
Implementation of a Raymarcher with 3D fractal SDFs.

## [Buddhabrot](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Buddhabrot)
Mandelbrot set variant rendered with a histogram.

## [Knots](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Knots)
Generation and triangulation of mathematical knots.

## [Lorenz System](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Lorenz-System)
Visualization of a Chaotic 3 variable system with a histogram.

## [Mobius Strip](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Mobius-Strip)
2 Variable parametric surface plotting and triangulation.

## [Cellular Automata]()
Simulation of individual cell behaviour being based on collective status.

# Tools Programming
## [Unity Road Generator](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Unity-Road-Generator)
Tool to generate road and curb meshes from Catmull-Rom Splines, in the Unity engine.

## [Cubic and Quadratic Splines](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Catmull-Rom-Splines)
General use Unity implementation.

## [Voxel Marching Cubes Terrain](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Voxel-Terrain)
Unity implementation of a voxel terrain using the Marching Cubes algorithm with realtime deformation.


# Procedural Generation
## [Low Poly Rock Generator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/low-poly-rock-generator-75041)
Randomly generates n vertices inside a sphere or cube and generates a convex mesh out of them. End result is stylized, low polygon-style rocks.

## [Low Poly Tree Generator](   )

# Generalist Projects
## [Unity Recycle Bin](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Recycle-Bin)
An editor extension for the Unity Engine that deals with temporarily storing items deleted from within the application, written in C# with OOP principles in mind.
