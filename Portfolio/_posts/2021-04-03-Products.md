## Realtime Edge Detection
This was a shader package that I made for a company as a freelancer. It displays an outline effect on complex models with different subparts, each one of them having a different colored outline that needs to be correctly displayed with the others. It was built using multiple Sobel Operator passes for each subpart, which all get combined together for the final image.

This was a very interesting and nerveracking project - I started out thinking I could get away with a simple Sobel Operator shader but soon realized their requirements were much more complex in terms of handling several different overlapping outlines at the same time. 

I was still in middle-school at the time, around age 14, a fact which I very happily omitted to my clients.


I cannot show the package of their complex model, but I have this render of it with a bunch of cubes. It looks much better with an actual model, but this is just to show its features.

## Low Poly Wind Shader
#### [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/low-poly-wind-shader-97675)

This is a shader package that I built and have been maintaining on the Unity Asset Store for a couple of years now. It allows for displacing vertices in a way that mimics wind, and really brings a low poly scene to life. It was one of my first interactions with shaders, and this package was a great way to learn about ways to integrate them with the Editor while maintaining a fast workflow.

## Low Poly Rock Generator
#### [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/low-poly-rock-generator-75041)

This is a Unity package that allows for in-editor and runtime generation of low-poly rocks. It uses the MIConvexHull library to generate a Convex Hull given a set of points. This Convex Hull, when the vertex count is low and it is flat shaded, looks like a low-poly style rock. 
This means that you can generate seemingly infinite rocks of all shapes and sizes, which removes repetition and adds a degree of novelty to your scenes.

I have been maintaining this on the Unity Asset Store for a couple years now, it has proved to be one of my most popular packages and was an important stepping stone into the world of procedural generation.

## Low Poly Tree Generator **(Deprecated)**

After finishing the first iteration of my Rock Generation, I figured it would be interesting to turn towards other low-poly elements, namely trees.
I eventually decided to sunset it because the codebase wasnÂ´t as flawless as I would like it to be and it the supporting it wasn't worth it given the revenue it was making. 

It worked in a similar way to my Rock Generator, using MIConvexHull for generating Convex meshes for the leaves and trunk:
The leaves were generated the same way my rocks were, except they were colored green. As for the trunk, IIRC, I generated circles of vertices and made a Convex Mesh 2 rings at a time, eventually linking them all together for the final thing. It was quite messy, but it worked.

It was a fun project regardless, and I might release it on GitHub eventually.
