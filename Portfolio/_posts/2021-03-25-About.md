My name is Jo√£o Costa, I'm a graphics and tools programmer from Portugal. I have been programming since early 2016. I am familiar with C#, HLSL, GLSL and Python. I have briefly used C++, HTML and CSS for personal projects, and I have no difficulty picking up a new language if the need arises. 

I maintain several packages for sale on the Unity Asset Store, and have an active Github presence.

I have freelanced for clients in the past, the main one being for a multimedia company putting together an interactive experience at a convention, where my contribution was extremely important to the final product.

Areas of expertise:
 - Unity3D
 - Graphics Programming (Shaders)
 - Procedural Generation
 - Data Scraping/Processing (Python)
