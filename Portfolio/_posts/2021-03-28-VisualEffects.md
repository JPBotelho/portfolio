## Health Bar
![Test](/assets/images/AnimatedBar.gif "ageag")

I made this health bar in a 48-hour Gamejam called Gamesforgood. Read more about the game [here]({% post_url 2021-03-27-Games %}#fome-de-vencer-hunger-to-win).

It has a scrolling texture and the color changes from green to red as your life depletes; it is very simple in theory and implementation but it is a practical example of actually using shaders in the real world rather than to keep in your github and put in your portfolio.

## Procedural Toon Shader
#### [Github](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Procedural-Toon-Shader)
{% include github-star.html content="https://github.com/JPBotelho/Procedural-Toon-Shader" %} 

Makes the lighting calculation not linear, instead it samples from a curve with predefined steps and giving a stylized look.
