## [C# OpenGL Engine](https://github.com/JPBotelho/OpenGL-Sandbox)
Barebones engine that implements model loading, skyboxes and simple shadowmapping.

## [Peanut Shader Engine](https://github.com/JPBotelho/Peanut-Shader-Engine)
An attempt to build a sandbox to build pixel shaders, facilitating input of textures and external variables. Ideally an offline Shatertoy, in practice an incomplete, simple quad renderer.
