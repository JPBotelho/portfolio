## Dogs Got Talent

This was a Rhythm game like Guitar Hero that was made for GamesForGood 2019 with me, [Kagamihara](https://kagamihara.itch.io/), [Lipera](https://itch.io/profile/lipera) on code, [Kamaraum](https://itch.io/profile/kamaraum) on sound and [Mateus Boga](https://www.instagram.com/mateusboga/) on art in the Unity Engine.

### **The Challenge**

This was a rhythm game.
I don't remember exactly everyting I implemented for this game, but the challenge I do remember was implementing the timing of the notes.

We needed a way of creating notes in the game "feed" when they were played in the song. It didn't need to be based on any actual musical notation, but it had to at least match to when they were played in the song.


See, none of us had ever really made a rhythm game, and apparently stuff like note recognition is a hard thing to understand and put together in two days. The solution? I wrote a script in Unity that took your keypresses and stored them as notes.
Then, when the game started, it played back the keypresses as notes in realtime. Basically, we had our composer listen to the song and play it on the arrow keys in a single take and that would serve as the "note map".

This worked susprisingly well; granted there was some delay due to human error but it was good enough to pass as working.

In retrospect, this probably would have worked better if I had somehow taken the song's bpm into account, "rounding" the timing of the generated notes to 16th notes.

But regardless, it felt like an ingenious hack for a problem that would be impossible to tackle in 2 days.

The notes were coming in from the right side of the screen.

## Fome de Vencer (Hunger to Win)

This game was made for GamesForGood 2018. Somehow, with a diverse set of social issues to choose as a theme, we chose to build a game about delivering food for the Portuguese Bank against Hunger (food charity). It was my first presencial Game Jam and it was a great experience.

### My Contribution 
I did some general programming here and there, but the most notable one is the health bar. I wrote about it [here]({% post_url 2021-03-28-VisualEffects %}#health-bar).

## Gravity
I made this game for Ludum Dare 36 in Aug. 2016 in the Unity engine. The theme was "Ancient Technology" and I found a way to bend it to the idea that I had brewing in the back of my mind to control the orientation of gravity by saying it was made by aliens or something.

It was one of my first projects, so it is rather simple. I made some more levels and features after the Game Jam for an android "release". There were no notable challenges for this one, but it is a neat little game.
