My name is Jo√£o Costa, I'm a graphics and tools programmer from Portugal. I have been programming since late 2015 and selling packages on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/21478) Since May of 2016. At first these packages were in the field of gameplay programming but have since shifted to procedural generation and visual effects. In this time period, I have occasionally done freelancing. You can read more about my most relevant freelance experience [here.](http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2019/08/09/Products.html#realtime-edge-detection)

Alongside my paid packages, I have 35+ open source repositories with comprehensive readmes on GitHub. Most of these are in the form of Unity shaders/graphics programming. My main goal with these is that they can serve as a reference for people trying to implement similar things.

I am well versed in C#, HLSL, GLSL and Python. I have briefly used C++, HTML and CSS for personal projects, and I have no difficulty picking up a new language if the need arises.
