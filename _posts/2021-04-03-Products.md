## Stylized Outline (freelance)

In August 2018 I freelanced for a company called [MVRK](https://mvrk.co/) as a Unity3D shader programmer. I was tasked with creating a package that rendered smooth, colored outlines for several overlapping submeshes (arms, legs, torso, etc).

My contribution was crucial to the success of the project, which the company displayed at the **Netflix FYSEE 2018** convention. 
The final result was a mixed-reality experience, where motion-tracked characters followed along to the movements of the audience. You can see it in action here:

## Low Poly Wind Shader
#### [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/low-poly-wind-shader-97675)

This is a shader package that I built and published on the Unity Asset Store in late 2017 and am still maintaining to date. It allows for displacing vertices in a way that mimics wind, and really brings a low poly scene to life. One of its biggest selling points is the user-experience: it does not require any extra maps and its integration with the editor assures a smooth workflow for non-technical users.

## Low Poly Rock Generator
#### [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/low-poly-rock-generator-75041)

This is a Unity package that allows for in-editor and runtime generation of low-poly rocks. It uses the MIConvexHull library to generate a convex mesh given a set of points. When generated with the right parameters, this generated mesh can be styled as a low-poly rock.
This means that you can generate seemingly infinite rocks of all shapes and sizes, which removes repetition and adds a degree of novelty to your scenes.

I have been maintaining this on the Unity Asset Store since late 2016, and it has proved to be one of my most popular packages and was an important stepping stone into the world of procedural generation.

## Low Poly Tree Generator **(Deprecated)**

After finishing the first iteration of my rock generator, I figured it would be interesting to turn towards other low-poly elements, namely trees.
It worked in a similar way to my previous package, using MIConvexHull to generate convex meshes for the leaves and trunk given the user's parameters.
I eventually decided to sunset it because the codebase was messy and the revenue wasn't worth the support.

It was a fun project regardless, and I might release it on GitHub eventually.
